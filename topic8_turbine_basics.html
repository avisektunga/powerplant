            <h2>Introduction to Steam Turbines</h2>
            <p>A steam turbine is a rotary mechanical device that extracts thermal energy from pressurized steam and converts it into useful rotary motion. This rotary motion is then typically used to drive an electrical generator to produce electricity, or to power machinery like pumps and compressors.</p>
            <p>The basic principle involves directing high-velocity jets of steam onto a series of blades attached to a rotor, causing the rotor to spin. The steam expands and cools as it passes through the turbine stages, giving up its energy to the blades.</p>

            <h2>Classification of Steam Turbines</h2>
            <p>Steam turbines can be classified based on various criteria:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Based on the Principle of Steam Action:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Impulse Turbine:</strong> The expansion of steam and the resulting pressure drop occur mainly in stationary nozzles. The high-velocity steam jets from the nozzles impinge on the moving blades, causing them to rotate due to the change in momentum (impulse force). Pressure across the moving blades remains relatively constant. Example: De Laval turbine, Curtis turbine (velocity compounded).</li>
                        <li><strong>Reaction Turbine:</strong> Steam expansion and pressure drop occur in both stationary (fixed) blades and moving blades. The moving blades are shaped like nozzles, causing further expansion and acceleration of steam relative to the blades. The rotation is caused by both impulse effect (due to entering steam) and reaction effect (due to accelerating steam leaving the blades). Example: Parsons turbine.</li>
                        <li><strong>Impulse-Reaction Turbine:</strong> Most modern large turbines are a combination, typically with impulse stages at the high-pressure end and reaction stages at the low-pressure end.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Based on the Direction of Steam Flow:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Axial Flow Turbine:</strong> Steam flows along the axis of the turbine shaft. Most common type for power generation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Radial Flow Turbine:</strong> Steam flows radially outwards or inwards. Example: Ljungstrom turbine (a type of reaction turbine). Tangential flow (Helical flow) turbines also exist but are less common.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Based on the Number of Stages:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Single-Stage Turbine:</strong> Expansion of steam from inlet to exhaust pressure occurs in a single stage (one set of nozzles and blades). Typically used for small power applications or as auxiliary drives. Example: De Laval turbine.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multi-Stage Turbine:</strong> Steam expansion is divided into multiple stages to improve efficiency and manage blade speeds. Each stage consists of a set of nozzles/fixed blades and moving blades. Most power plant turbines are multi-stage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Based on Steam Inlet/Exhaust Conditions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Condensing Turbine:</strong> Exhaust steam pressure is below atmospheric pressure (vacuum), maintained by a condenser. Maximizes enthalpy drop and efficiency. Common in power plants.</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-Condensing (Back-Pressure) Turbine:</strong> Exhaust steam pressure is above atmospheric pressure. The exhaust steam is used for process heating (cogeneration).</li>
                        <li><strong>Extraction (Pass-Out) Turbine:</strong> Steam is extracted from one or more intermediate stages at specific pressures for process use or feedwater heating, while the remaining steam continues to expand to the exhaust.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reheat Turbine:</strong> Steam is extracted after partial expansion in the HP turbine, returned to the boiler for reheating, and then readmitted to the IP/LP turbine.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Based on Type of Compounding (for Impulse Turbines):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pressure Compounding (Rateau staging)</li>
                        <li>Velocity Compounding (Curtis staging)</li>
                        <li>Pressure-Velocity Compounding</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Based on Casing Arrangement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Single Casing</li>
                        <li>Tandem Compound (Multiple casings driving a single generator on one shaft)</li>
                        <li>Cross Compound (Multiple casings driving separate generators or on parallel shafts)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <h4>Working Principle of a Single-Stage Impulse Turbine:</h4>
                        <p>The fundamental principle of an impulse turbine is the conversion of the kinetic energy of a high-velocity fluid jet into mechanical work by changing the direction (and hence momentum) of the fluid flow.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Nozzle Action:</strong> High-pressure steam from the boiler is expanded in one or more stationary nozzles. In the nozzles, the pressure energy of the steam is converted into kinetic energy, resulting in a high-velocity jet of steam. The pressure of the steam drops significantly as it passes through the nozzle, but its velocity increases substantially.</li>
                            <li><strong>Impulse on Blades:</strong> This high-velocity steam jet is then directed onto a series of curved blades (often cup-shaped or symmetrical profile) mounted on the periphery of a rotor (wheel). The steam impinges on the concave surface of the blades.</li>
                            <li><strong>Change in Momentum:</strong> As the steam flows over the curved surface of the blades, its direction of velocity changes. This change in direction results in a change in the momentum of the steam. According to Newton's second law (F = rate of change of momentum), this change in momentum exerts a force (impulse force) on the blades.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rotor Rotation:</strong> This tangential force on the blades creates a torque on the rotor, causing it to rotate and produce mechanical work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Constant Pressure Across Moving Blades (Ideal):</strong> Ideally, in a pure impulse stage, there is no pressure drop across the moving blades. The steam pressure remains constant as it passes over the blades. In reality, there might be a slight pressure drop due to friction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Energy Transfer:</strong> The kinetic energy of the steam jet is absorbed by the blades, resulting in a reduction in the absolute velocity of the steam as it leaves the blades.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li><strong>V<sub>w1</sub>, V<sub>w2</sub>:</strong> Velocities of whirl (tangential components of V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>, respectively). V<sub>w1</sub> = V<sub>1</sub>cosα<sub>1</sub>. V<sub>w2</sub> = V<sub>2</sub>cosα<sub>2</sub>.</li>
                            <li><strong>V<sub>f1</sub>, V<sub>f2</sub>:</strong> Velocities of flow (axial components of V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>, respectively). V<sub>f1</sub> = V<sub>1</sub>sinα<sub>1</sub>. V<sub>f2</sub> = V<sub>2</sub>sinα<sub>2</sub>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Work Done and Power:</strong> The tangential force on the blades is due to the change in the velocity of whirl.
                        <br>Work done per unit mass of steam = U × (V<sub>w1</sub> ± V<sub>w2</sub>). The sign depends on the direction of V<sub>w2</sub>. If V<sub>w1</sub> and V<sub>w2</sub> are in the same direction (common in impulse), it's U(V<sub>w1</sub> - V<sub>w2</sub>) if V<sub>w2</sub> is positive, or U(V<sub>w1</sub> + |V<sub>w2</sub>|) if V<sub>w2</sub> is in the opposite direction of U. A more general form is U × ΔV<sub>w</sub>.
                        <br>Power = ṁ × U × (V<sub>w1</sub> ± V<sub>w2</sub>), where ṁ is the mass flow rate of steam.</p>
                        <p><em>A detailed drawing of the velocity triangles at inlet and outlet, combined at their base (U), would typically be required. The diagram above is a highly simplified representation.</em></p>
