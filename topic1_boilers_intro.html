                    <summary><strong>2023 Q4: Sketch of Babcock & Wilcox boiler.</strong></summary>
                    <div class="pyq-answer">
                        <p>The Babcock & Wilcox boiler is a horizontal, externally fired, natural circulation water tube boiler. Its main components include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Steam-Water Drum:</strong> A large horizontal drum at the top where saturated steam separates from water.</li>
                            <li><strong>Water Tubes:</strong> Inclined tubes (typically at about 15° to the horizontal) connecting the uptake header and downtake header. Water circulates through these tubes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Headers (Uptake and Downtake):</strong> Boxes at the front and rear ends to which the water tubes are connected. The uptake header is higher than the downtake header.</li>
                            <li><strong>Furnace:</strong> Located below the tubes, where fuel is combusted.</li>
                            <li><strong>Baffles:</strong> Firebrick baffles are placed across the tubes to direct the flow of hot flue gases, ensuring they make multiple passes over the tubes for maximum heat transfer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Superheater Tubes (if equipped):</strong> Located in the path of flue gases, usually above the main bank of water tubes, to superheat the steam from the drum.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mud Box/Drum:</strong> Connected to the downtake header to collect sediment and impurities, which can be removed through a blow-down valve.</li>
                            <li><strong>Downcomer Pipes:</strong> Connect the steam-water drum to the downtake header (or mud drum) to supply water to the tubes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Riser Pipes:</strong> Connect the uptake header to the steam-water drum, carrying the steam-water mixture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Safety Valve, Water Level Indicator, Pressure Gauge, Feed Check Valve:</strong> Essential mountings for safe operation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>(Ideally, this would be accompanied by a hand-drawn sketch or a reference to the image already on the page. Since we have an image of a B&W boiler, we can refer to it.)</em></p>
                        <p>Please refer to the Water Tube Boiler diagram (Babcock & Wilcox) shown earlier on this page for a visual representation. Key features to note in a sketch would be the inclined tubes, the steam drum above, the headers, and the path of flue gases guided by baffles.</p>

                        <p><strong>Working:</strong> Feedwater enters the steam-water drum. Water flows down through downcomer pipes to the downtake header, then up through the inclined water tubes where it is heated by hot flue gases from the furnace. The steam-water mixture rises to the uptake header and then into the steam-water drum. Steam separates and is collected at the top of the drum (and may go to a superheater), while water recirculates. Flue gases pass over the tubes, directed by baffles, and then exit to the chimney via an economizer or air preheater (if present).</p>

                    <summary><strong>2019 Q11e: Short note on Cochran boiler.</strong></summary>
                    <div class="pyq-answer">
                        <p>The Cochran boiler is a vertical, multi-tubular, internally fired, natural circulation fire-tube boiler. It is known for its compact design and efficiency for small to medium steam requirements.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Vertical Cylindrical Shell:</strong> The main body of the boiler.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dome-shaped Furnace (Combustion Chamber):</strong> Located at the bottom, hemispherical in shape to provide strength and efficient combustion. It is internally fired.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fire Tubes:</strong> Numerous horizontal tubes through which hot flue gases pass from the furnace to the smokebox. Water surrounds these tubes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Smokebox:</strong> Located at the top, it collects the flue gases from the fire tubes before they are discharged to the chimney. An access door is provided for cleaning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chimney:</strong> Mounted on top of the smokebox.</li>
                            <li><strong>No Brickwork Setting:</strong> It is self-contained and does not require external brickwork, making it portable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Manhole and Handholes:</strong> Provided for inspection and cleaning of the internal parts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Standard Mountings:</strong> Equipped with safety valve, pressure gauge, water level indicator, feed check valve, steam stop valve, blow-off cock, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Working Principle:</strong></p>
                        <p>Fuel is burned in the furnace. The hot flue gases rise from the furnace and pass through the horizontal fire tubes. Heat from these hot gases is transferred to the surrounding water, generating steam. The flue gases then enter the smokebox and are discharged to the atmosphere through the chimney. Water circulates naturally due to density differences.</p>
                        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Compact and requires less floor space due to its vertical design.</li>
                            <li>Easy to install and portable.</li>
                            <li>Relatively low initial cost.</li>
                            <li>Good thermal efficiency for its size (around 70-75%).</li>
                            <li>Quick steam generation compared to other fire tube boilers like Lancashire.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Limited steam pressure and capacity compared to larger boilers.</li>
                            <li>Water volume is relatively small, so it may have difficulty meeting sudden large steam demands.</li>
                            <li>Cleaning and inspection of fire tubes can be somewhat difficult.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Commonly used in small industries, laundries, chemical plants, and for auxiliary steam on ships where space is a constraint and moderate steam demand is required.</p>
