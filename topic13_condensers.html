            <h2>Introduction to Condensing Systems</h2>
            <p>In steam power plants, a condensing system is used to condense the exhaust steam from the low-pressure (LP) turbine outlet. The primary component of this system is the **condenser**. Condensing the exhaust steam serves several crucial purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creates Vacuum at Turbine Exhaust:</strong> When steam condenses, its specific volume drastically reduces (e.g., steam at 0.1 bar has a specific volume of about 14.67 m³/kg, while water at the same pressure has about 0.001 m³/kg). This rapid volume reduction creates a vacuum (pressure well below atmospheric) at the turbine exhaust.</li>
                <li><strong>Increases Turbine Work Output & Efficiency:</strong> The vacuum at the exhaust allows the steam to expand to a much lower pressure in the turbine, thereby increasing the enthalpy drop across the turbine and significantly increasing the work output and thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovers High-Purity Condensate:</strong> The condensed steam (condensate) is high-purity water, which can be reused as boiler feedwater, minimizing the need for extensive makeup water treatment. This is particularly important for surface condensers.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduces Exhaust Steam Volume:</strong> Handling a large volume of exhaust steam directly would require enormous exhaust ducting and stacks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The condensing system typically includes the condenser itself, cooling water pumps, condensate extraction pumps, and an air extraction system (vacuum pump or steam jet ejector) to remove non-condensable gases.</p>

            <h2>Classification of Condensers</h2>
            <p>Condensers are broadly classified based on how the cooling medium (usually water) interacts with the exhaust steam:</p>

            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Direct Contact (Jet) Condensers:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In these condensers, the exhaust steam and the cooling water come into direct contact and mix intimately. The steam gives up its latent heat to the cooling water, and the mixture of condensate and cooling water is then pumped out.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sub-types:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Parallel Flow Jet Condenser:</strong> Steam and cooling water flow in the same direction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Counter Flow (Low-Level) Jet Condenser:</strong> Steam flows upwards, and cooling water sprays downwards. Requires a condensate extraction pump.</li>
                                <li><strong>Barometric (High-Level) Jet Condenser:</strong> A type of counter flow condenser placed at a height of at least 10.36 meters (barometric height) above the hotwell. The condensate and cooling water drain out by gravity through a long tailpipe (barometric leg), eliminating the need for an extraction pump.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ejector Condenser:</strong> Uses a series of converging nozzles for cooling water and a diverging cone. Steam is entrained and condensed by the high-velocity water jets.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Indirect Contact (Surface) Condensers:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In these condensers, the exhaust steam and the cooling water do **not** mix directly. They are separated by a heat transfer surface, typically a large number of tubes.</li>
                        <li>Exhaust steam flows over the outer surface of the tubes, while cooling water flows through the inside of the tubes (or vice-versa in some designs). Heat is transferred from the steam to the cooling water through the tube walls, causing the steam to condense.</li>
                        <li>The condensate (pure water) is collected in a hotwell and can be reused as boiler feedwater.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sub-types (based on shell design and flow paths):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Downflow Surface Condenser:</strong> Steam enters at the top and flows downwards over the tube banks. Air extraction is usually from the bottom.</li>
                                <li><strong>Central Flow Surface Condenser:</strong> Steam enters the shell radially inwards towards a central suction point for air extraction, improving heat transfer and reducing undercooling of condensate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Regenerative Surface Condenser:</strong> Designed so that the condensate is reheated by passing through some of the incoming exhaust steam, reducing undercooling and improving thermal efficiency.</li>
                                <li><strong>Evaporative Condenser:</strong> Steam condenses inside tubes over which air is blown and water is sprayed. Latent heat is removed primarily by evaporation of the sprayed water. Used where cooling water is scarce.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Surface condensers are almost exclusively used in large thermal power plants due to the need for high-purity feedwater.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <p>A surface condenser is a type of shell-and-tube heat exchanger designed to condense exhaust steam from a turbine by transferring its latent heat to a cooling medium (usually water) without direct contact between the steam and the coolant.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Shell:</strong> A large, airtight cylindrical or rectangular vessel that encloses the tube bundle and provides space for steam distribution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tube Bundle:</strong> Consists of a large number of small-diameter tubes (typically made of brass, stainless steel, or titanium) through which cooling water flows. The tubes are fixed between two tube plates at either end of the shell.</li>
                            <li><strong>Water Boxes:</strong> Enclosures at each end of the condenser that distribute cooling water to the tubes and collect it after it has passed through them. They often have partitions to create multiple passes for the cooling water, increasing its velocity and heat transfer efficiency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Steam Inlet:</strong> A large opening at the top or side of the shell where exhaust steam from the turbine enters.</li>
                            <li><strong>Condensate Outlet (Hotwell):</strong> A collection point, usually at the bottom of the shell, where the condensed steam (condensate) accumulates. A condensate extraction pump removes this water.</li>
                            <li><strong>Air Extraction Outlet:</strong> An outlet connected to an air extraction system (vacuum pump or steam jet ejector) to remove air and other non-condensable gases that leak into the system or are released from the steam. This is crucial for maintaining the vacuum.</li>
                            <li><strong>Baffle Plates/Support Plates:</strong> Used within the shell to direct steam flow across the tubes for better heat transfer and to support the long tubes, preventing vibration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Working Principle:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Exhaust steam from the low-pressure turbine outlet, at a very low pressure (vacuum), enters the condenser shell.</li>
                            <li>Cooling water (from a river, lake, sea, or cooling tower) is pumped through the inside of the numerous tubes in the tube bundle.</li>
                            <li>The exhaust steam comes into contact with the cold outer surfaces of these tubes.</li>
                            <li>Heat is transferred from the steam to the cooling water through the tube walls. The steam loses its latent heat of vaporization and condenses into liquid water (condensate).</li>
                            <li>The condensate droplets fall from the tubes and collect in the hotwell at the bottom of the condenser.</li>
                            <li>The condensate, being high-purity water, is then pumped by the condensate extraction pump back to the boiler feedwater system (usually via deaerators and feedwater heaters).</li>
                            <li>Air and other non-condensable gases that enter with the steam or leak into the vacuum system do not condense. They accumulate and would reduce the vacuum and heat transfer efficiency if not removed. An air extraction system continuously removes these gases, maintaining the desired low pressure (high vacuum) in the condenser.</li>
                            <li>The cooling water, having absorbed the heat from the steam, becomes warmer and is discharged from the condenser. It may be returned to its source or sent to a cooling tower to be cooled and recirculated.</li>
