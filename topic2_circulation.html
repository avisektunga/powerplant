            <h2>Natural Circulation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Occurs due to the density difference between the relatively cool water in the downcomers and the hotter water/steam mixture in the risers (heated tubes).</li>
                <li>Heated water/steam mixture in risers becomes less dense and moves upwards into the steam drum.</li>
                <li>Cooler, denser water from the drum flows downwards through downcomers to replace the water in the risers, creating a continuous circulation loop.</li>
                <li>This is a thermosyphon effect. The driving force is the difference in hydrostatic head between the downcomer and riser columns.</li>
                <li>Common in low to medium pressure boilers (e.g., many water-tube boilers like Babcock & Wilcox).</li>

            <h2>Forced Circulation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>An external pump (boiler circulation pump - BCP) is used to mechanically circulate water through the boiler tubes.</li>
                <li>Ensures adequate and controlled flow rate through all heated tubes, irrespective of density differences or heat input distribution.</li>
                <li>Used in high-pressure boilers (e.g., some subcritical and all supercritical boilers like Benson, Velox, Loeffler) where the natural circulation head might be insufficient to overcome flow resistances or to ensure adequate cooling of tubes.</li>
                <li>Allows for more flexible boiler design, including horizontal or even downward-sloping tubes.</li>
                <li>Once-through boilers inherently use forced circulation.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Critical Pressure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The specific pressure (and temperature) point for a substance (like water) at which its liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable. There is no distinct phase change (boiling) above this point.</li>
                <li>Above critical pressure, water transforms directly into a supercritical fluid, which has properties of both a liquid and a gas (e.g., density of a liquid but viscosity of a gas).</li>
                <li>For water:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Critical Pressure ($P_c$): approximately 22.12 MPa (221.2 bar or 3208 psia).</li>
                        <li>Critical Temperature ($T_c$): approximately 374 °C (647 K or 705 °F).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Boilers operating above this pressure are called supercritical boilers (e.g., Benson boiler). They do not have a steam drum as there is no distinct water-steam separation.</li>

            <div class="pyq-item">
                <details>
                    <summary><strong>2017 Q10b: Define circulation ratio and explain natural circulation.</strong></summary>
                    <div class="pyq-answer">
                        <h4>Circulation Ratio (CR):</h4>
                        <p>The circulation ratio is defined as the ratio of the mass flow rate of the water/steam mixture entering the heated riser tubes to the mass flow rate of steam generated (or leaving the steam drum/circuit).</p>
                        <p><code>CR = (Mass flow rate of water entering risers) / (Mass flow rate of steam generated)</code></p>
                        <p>Alternatively, if 'x' is the dryness fraction of the steam-water mixture at the riser outlet, then CR = 1/x.</p>
                        <p>It indicates how many times water circulates through the heated tubes for each unit of steam produced. For example, a CR of 10 means that for every 1 kg of steam produced, 10 kg of water enters the riser tubes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A higher circulation ratio ensures adequate cooling of the tubes, preventing overheating and failure (burnout), especially in highly heated zones.</li>
                            <li>It helps in maintaining a wetted surface inside the tubes.</li>
                            <li>Typical values for natural circulation boilers range from 6 to 30, depending on pressure and design.</li>
                            <li>For once-through boilers, the circulation ratio is unity (CR=1) as all feedwater is converted to steam in a single pass.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Natural Circulation:</h4>
                        <p>Natural circulation in a boiler occurs due to the density difference created by heating the water. The process is as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Feedwater enters the steam drum.</li>
                            <li>Relatively cool and denser water flows from the steam drum down through unheated or less heated pipes called "downcomers" to the lower drum or water headers.</li>
                            <li>From the lower drum/headers, water enters the heated "riser" tubes, which are exposed to the furnace heat.</li>
                            <li>As water in the risers absorbs heat, it gets converted into a steam-water mixture (or entirely steam in some parts). This mixture is much less dense than the water in the downcomers.</li>
                            <li>Due to this density difference, the lighter steam-water mixture in the risers moves upwards, driven by the buoyant force, and returns to the steam drum.</li>
                            <li>In the steam drum, steam separates from the water. The steam is drawn off for use, and the separated water mixes with incoming feedwater and recirculates through the downcomers.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This continuous flow, driven by the thermosyphon effect (density differences caused by temperature gradients), is known as natural circulation. The driving pressure for this circulation is the difference in hydrostatic heads between the column of water in the downcomers and the column of steam-water mixture in the risers.</p>

                    <summary><strong>2019 Q6: Circulation ratio, TDF (Total Dissolved Solids), downcomers and risers.</strong></summary>
                    <div class="pyq-answer">
                        <h4>Circulation Ratio (CR):</h4>
                        <p><em>(Refer to the explanation provided in the answer to 2017 Q10b above.)</em></p>

                        <h4>TDF (Total Dissolved Solids):</h4>
                        <p>TDF refers to the total amount of dissolved inorganic salts and small amounts of organic matter present in water. In boiler water, common dissolved solids include carbonates, bicarbonates, chlorides, sulfates, phosphates, and silicates of calcium, magnesium, and sodium.</p>
                        <p><strong>Significance in Boilers:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Scale Formation:</strong> As water evaporates to form steam, the concentration of dissolved solids increases. If certain solids (like calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, magnesium silicate) exceed their solubility limits, they precipitate out and form hard deposits (scale) on the heat transfer surfaces (tubes). Scale reduces heat transfer efficiency, can lead to tube overheating and failure, and can obstruct flow.</li>
                            <li><strong>Corrosion:</strong> Some dissolved solids, like chlorides and sulfates, can contribute to corrosion of boiler components.</li>
                            <li><strong>Carryover/Priming & Foaming:</strong> High TDF concentrations can lead to foaming (formation of stable bubbles on the water surface in the drum) and priming (entrainment of water droplets with the steam). This results in impure steam, which can cause deposits and damage in superheaters, turbines, and other equipment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Control:</strong> TDF in boiler water is controlled by:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pre-treating feedwater (e.g., softening, demineralization) to remove solids before they enter the boiler.</li>
                                    <li>Regular "blowdown" of boiler water from the drum or lower points to remove concentrated solids. The amount of blowdown is determined by the maximum permissible TDF level for the boiler's operating pressure.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Downcomers:</h4>
                        <p>Downcomers are large diameter pipes in a natural circulation boiler that carry relatively cool and dense water from the steam drum downwards to the lower water drum or bottom headers. They are typically located outside the main heat zone of the furnace or are minimally heated to ensure the water within them remains as dense as possible. This high density in the downcomers provides the driving hydrostatic head necessary for natural circulation.</p>

                        <h4>Risers (Water Wall Tubes / Evaporator Tubes):</h4>
                        <p>Risers are the tubes in a boiler that are exposed to the heat of the furnace (e.g., forming the walls of the furnace, known as water walls, or in the convection bank). Water from the downcomers flows into these tubes, absorbs heat, and a portion of it is converted into steam. The resulting steam-water mixture, being less dense than the water in the downcomers, flows upwards (rises) back to the steam drum where steam is separated.</p>

                    <p><em>(Note: Actual values from steam tables should be used for precise calculations. These are approximate.)</em></p>

                    <h4>Step 2: Calculate Riser Inner Diameter and Flow Area</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inner Diameter (ID) = OD - 2 × t = 76.2 mm - 2 × 6 mm = 76.2 - 12 = 64.2 mm = 0.0642 m</li>
                        <li>Flow Area (A) = π/4 × (ID)<sup>2</sup> = π/4 × (0.0642)<sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.003237 m<sup>2</sup></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Step 3: Determine Dryness Fraction (x) at Riser Exit</h4>
                    <p>Circulation Ratio (CR) = 1/x</p>
                    <p>x = 1 / CR = 1 / 12.5 = 0.08</p>

                    <h4>Step 4: Calculate Void Fraction (α) at Riser Exit</h4>
                    <p>The void fraction is given by the formula:</p>
                    <p class="formula">α = x / [x + S × (1-x) × (v<sub>f</sub> / v<sub>g</sub>)]</p>
                    <p>Substituting the values:</p>
                    <p class="formula">α = 0.08 / [0.08 + 1.2 × (1-0.08) × (0.001384 / 0.02352)]</p>
                    <p class="formula">α = 0.08 / [0.08 + 1.2 × 0.92 × 0.05884]</p>
                    <p class="formula">α = 0.08 / [0.08 + 0.06497]</p>
                    <p class="formula">α = 0.08 / 0.14497 ≈ 0.5518</p>
                    <p><strong>(ii) Void fraction at riser exit (α) ≈ 0.552 or 55.2%</strong></p>

                    <h4>Step 5: Calculate Density of Mixture (ρ<sub>m</sub>) at Riser Exit</h4>
                    <p>Density of the two-phase mixture at exit:</p>
                    <p class="formula">ρ<sub>m</sub> = αρ<sub>g</sub> + (1-α)ρ<sub>f</sub></p>
                    <p class="formula">ρ<sub>m</sub> = (0.5518 × 42.52) + (1-0.5518) × 722.54</p>
                    <p class="formula">ρ<sub>m</sub> = 23.462 + (0.4482 × 722.54)</p>
                    <p class="formula">ρ<sub>m</sub> = 23.462 + 323.85</p>
                    <p class="formula">ρ<sub>m</sub> ≈ 347.31 kg/m<sup>3</sup></p>
                    <p>Average density in the riser can be approximated as (ρ<sub>f</sub> + ρ<sub>m</sub>)/2 for simplified pressure head calculation if uniform heating is assumed, or by integrating. For a more accurate approach to natural circulation head, we consider the downcomer filled with ρ<sub>f</sub> and riser with an average density. The mean density in riser (ρ<sub>riser,mean</sub>) can be complex if void fraction changes along the length. A common simplification is to use exit mixture density if heat input is mostly at the bottom, or an average. Let's use ρ<sub>m</sub> as the mean density of the fluid column in the riser for calculating the effective head reduction due to steam formation for this part of the question referring to "pressure head developed" in the context of circulation driving force.</p>


                    <h4>Step 6: Calculate Pressure Head Developed (Driving Pressure Head)</h4>
                    <p>The pressure head developed by natural circulation is due to the density difference between the water in the downcomer (assumed to be ρ<sub>f</sub>) and the average density of the mixture in the riser. Assuming the downcomer has the same height L.</p>
                    <p>Driving Pressure (ΔP) = g × L × (ρ<sub>f</sub> - ρ<sub>riser,mean</sub>)</p>
                    <p>Here, ρ<sub>riser,mean</sub> can be approximated. If we consider average void fraction: average void fraction α<sub>avg</sub> ≈ α<sub>exit</sub> / 2 (if void starts from 0 at inlet to α<sub>exit</sub> at outlet linearly).</p>
                    <p>α<sub>avg</sub> = 0.5518 / 2 = 0.2759</p>
                    <p>ρ<sub>riser,mean</sub> = α<sub>avg</sub>ρ<sub>g</sub> + (1-α<sub>avg</sub>)ρ<sub>f</sub></p>
                    <p>ρ<sub>riser,mean</sub> = (0.2759 × 42.52) + (1-0.2759) × 722.54</p>
                    <p>ρ<sub>riser,mean</sub> = 11.731 + (0.7241 × 722.54) = 11.731 + 523.19 ≈ 534.92 kg/m<sup>3</sup></p>
                    <p>Driving Pressure (ΔP) = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> × 18 m × (722.54 kg/m<sup>3</sup> - 534.92 kg/m<sup>3</sup>)</p>
                    <p>ΔP = 9.81 × 18 × 187.62 = 33130.4 Pa ≈ 33.13 kPa</p>
                    <p>Pressure Head (H) = ΔP / (ρ<sub>f</sub> × g)  (expressed as head of cold water)</p>
                    <p>H = 33130.4 Pa / (722.54 kg/m<sup>3</sup> × 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>) ≈ 4.67 m of saturated water</p>
                    <p><strong>(i) The pressure head developed ≈ 33.13 kPa (or 4.67 m of saturated water column)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Note: This head must overcome frictional losses in the circuit for circulation to occur.</em></p>

                    <h4>Step 7: Calculate Heat Transfer Rate (Q)</h4>
                    <p>Mass flow rate of water at inlet (ṁ<sub>w,in</sub>) = ρ<sub>f</sub> × A × V<sub>f,in</sub></p>
                    <p>ṁ<sub>w,in</sub> = 722.54 kg/m<sup>3</sup> × 0.003237 m<sup>2</sup> × 1.4 m/s ≈ 3.273 kg/s</p>
                    <p>Mass flow rate of steam generated (ṁ<sub>s</sub>) = ṁ<sub>w,in</sub> / CR = 3.273 kg/s / 12.5 ≈ 0.2618 kg/s</p>
                    <p>Total heat added to the water in the riser (Q<sub>total</sub>) = ṁ<sub>s</sub> × h<sub>fg</sub> (since water enters saturated and steam leaves with dryness x, the net heat is to produce x fraction of steam from the total flow, or simply mass of steam generated * latent heat)</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, Q<sub>total</sub> = ṁ<sub>w,in</sub> × (h<sub>exit</sub> - h<sub>inlet</sub>)</p>
                    <p>h<sub>inlet</sub> = h<sub>f</sub> @ 80 bar ≈ 1317 kJ/kg</p>
                    <p>h<sub>exit</sub> = h<sub>f</sub> + x × h<sub>fg</sub> = 1317 + 0.08 × 1441 = 1317 + 115.28 = 1432.28 kJ/kg</p>
                    <p>Q<sub>total</sub> = 3.273 kg/s × (1432.28 - 1317) kJ/kg = 3.273 × 115.28 kJ/s ≈ 377.3 kW</p>
                    <p>(Using ṁ<sub>s</sub> × h<sub>fg</sub> = 0.2618 kg/s × 1441 kJ/kg ≈ 377.25 kW - consistent)</p>

                    <h4>Step 8: Calculate Heat Transfer Rate per Unit Projected Area (q'')</h4>
                    <p>Projected Area of the riser tube (A<sub>proj</sub>) = OD × L (This is the area facing the radiant heat source if it's a single tube. If it's heat flux based on inner surface area, it would be π × ID × L)</p>
                    <p>Assuming "projected area" refers to the side view area for external heating:</p>
                    <p>A<sub>proj</sub> = 0.0762 m × 18 m ≈ 1.3716 m<sup>2</sup></p>
                    <p>Heat transfer rate per unit projected area (q''):</p>
                    <p>q'' = Q<sub>total</sub> / A<sub>proj</sub> = 377.3 kW / 1.3716 m<sup>2</sup> ≈ 275.1 kW/m<sup>2</sup></p>
                    <p><strong>(iii) The heat transfer rate per unit projected area ≈ 275.1 kW/m<sup>2</sup></strong></p>
