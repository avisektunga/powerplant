            <h2>Draught (Draft)</h2>
            <p>Draught is the small pressure difference between the atmosphere and the gases within a boiler system (furnace, flue gas passages, chimney) that causes the flow of air into the furnace and the flow of combustion products (flue gases) out through the chimney. It is essential for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supplying sufficient air for complete combustion of fuel.</li>
                <li>Removing the products of combustion from the furnace.</li>
                <li>Dispersing flue gases into the atmosphere at a suitable height.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Draught can be classified into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Draught:</strong> Created by the chimney effect due to the density difference between the hot flue gases inside the chimney and the cooler ambient air outside. The hotter, lighter gases in the chimney rise, creating a lower pressure at the chimney base, which draws air and flue gases through the system. Taller chimneys produce greater natural draught.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Draught:</strong> Created using mechanical means, typically fans. It is more controllable and can achieve much higher pressure differences than natural draught, necessary for modern large boilers with high resistances.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mechanical Draught:</strong> Uses fans (Forced Draught, Induced Draught, or Balanced Draught).</li>
                        <li><strong>Steam Jet Draught:</strong> Uses high-velocity jets of steam to induce or force air/gas flow. Less common in modern large boilers due to lower efficiency and steam consumption, but sometimes used in locomotives or small boilers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Induced Draught (ID Fan)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>An ID fan is located in the flue gas path, typically between the boiler's last heat recovery unit (e.g., air preheater or ESP/baghouse) and the chimney.</li>
                <li>It draws (induces) flue gases out of the furnace and through the boiler passes, dust collectors, and other equipment.</li>
                <li>This creates a negative pressure (below atmospheric pressure) throughout the furnace and flue gas system up to the fan inlet. The pressure at the ID fan outlet is slightly positive to discharge gases up the chimney.</li>
                <li>Maintaining a slightly negative furnace pressure (e.g., -5 to -10 mm of water column) is crucial to prevent leakage of hot, toxic flue gases and fly ash into the boiler house, ensuring operator safety and cleanliness.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Forced Draught (FD Fan)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>An FD fan is located at the air inlet side of the boiler system, typically before the air preheater (if present) or directly supplying air to the windbox and burners/grate.</li>
                <li>It pushes (forces) combustion air into the furnace at a pressure above atmospheric.</li>
                <li>This creates a positive pressure in the windbox and potentially in the furnace if only an FD fan is used (pressurized furnace).</li>
            </ul>
             <img src="images/boiler_draught.png" alt="Boiler Draught Diagram (showing FD and ID fans for balanced draught)" class="diagram">
             <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">Typical Balanced Draught System</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Balanced Draught</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This system uses both an FD fan and an ID fan operating in conjunction.</li>
                <li>The FD fan supplies the required quantity of combustion air to the furnace.</li>
                <li>The ID fan removes the flue gases from the furnace and maintains the furnace pressure at a desired slightly negative value (e.g., -5 to -10 mm WC).</li>
                <li>This combination offers precise control over both air supply and furnace pressure, preventing both blowback of hot gases (if furnace pressure is too high) and excessive air ingress (if furnace pressure is too low).</li>
                <li>Balanced draught is the most common system for medium to large utility and industrial boilers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Secondary Air Fans (SA Fans)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In addition to primary air (mixed with fuel at the burner or supplied under the grate), secondary air is often required for complete combustion.</li>
                <li>SA fans supply this additional air, usually at a higher pressure than primary air, into the furnace at strategic locations above or around the main combustion zone.</li>
                <li><strong>Functions of Secondary Air:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensures complete combustion of volatile matter and unburnt carbon particles released from the fuel.</li>
                        <li>Improves turbulence and mixing in the furnace.</li>
                        <li>Can be used for staged combustion to control NOx formation by creating fuel-rich and fuel-lean zones.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In some systems, the FD fan may be designed to supply both primary and secondary air through different ducts and dampers. However, in large pulverized coal boilers or fluidized bed boilers, separate SA fans (and sometimes Tertiary Air fans) are common for better control.</li>
            </ul>

                    <div class="pyq-answer">
                        <h4>Induced Draught (ID) Fan</h4>
                        <p>An Induced Draught (ID) fan is a crucial component in most medium to large boiler systems, responsible for extracting flue gases from the boiler furnace and discharging them to the atmosphere via the chimney.</p>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> It is typically installed after all heat recovery equipment (like economizers, air preheaters) and pollution control devices (like electrostatic precipitators or bag filters), but before the chimney.</p>
                        <p><strong>Function and Working:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The primary function of the ID fan is to create a negative pressure (suction) within the furnace and the flue gas passages of the boiler. This negative pressure ensures that:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Combustion air is drawn into the furnace (especially if no FD fan is present or in conjunction with an FD fan).</li>
                                    <li>Hot combustion products (flue gases) are effectively pulled through the various sections of the boiler (superheaters, reheaters, economizer, air preheater) and pollution control equipment.</li>
                                    <li>It overcomes the flow resistance offered by these components and ductwork.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>By maintaining a furnace pressure slightly below atmospheric (e.g., -5 to -10 mm water column), the ID fan prevents the leakage of hot, toxic flue gases and fly ash from the furnace into the boiler house. This is vital for operator safety and plant cleanliness.</li>
                            <li>The ID fan handles hot, often corrosive, and dust-laden flue gases. Therefore, its construction materials and design (e.g., blade type, bearings) must be robust and suitable for such harsh conditions.</li>
                            <li>The capacity and speed of the ID fan are controlled to match the boiler load and maintain the desired furnace pressure. Variable speed drives (VSDs) or inlet guide vanes (IGVs) are commonly used for this control, enhancing energy efficiency.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>In Balanced Draught Systems:</strong> The ID fan works in conjunction with a Forced Draught (FD) fan. The FD fan supplies air, while the ID fan removes flue gases, and their combined operation maintains the furnace at the desired slight negative pressure.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the ID fan is essential for proper flue gas removal, maintaining safe furnace operating conditions, and enabling efficient heat recovery in boiler systems.</p>
