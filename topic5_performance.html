            <h2>Boiler Efficiency ($\eta$): How Good is Your Boiler at its Job?</h2>
            <p>Think of boiler efficiency like a grade on a report card. It tells us how well the boiler is converting the energy from fuel (like coal or gas) into useful heat in the steam. A higher grade (efficiency) means less wasted fuel and more bang for your buck!</p>
            <p><strong>The Basic Idea:</strong></p>
            <div class="formula-block">
                Boiler Efficiency ($\eta$) = $\frac{\text{Useful Heat Energy Transferred to Steam}}{\text{Total Heat Energy Supplied by Fuel}} \times 100\%$
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Analogy: Making Popcorn!</strong>
                <br><strong>Heat Supplied:</strong> The energy your microwave uses (or the gas your stove burns).
                <br><strong>Useful Heat Output:</strong> The energy that actually goes into popping the kernels.
                <br><strong>Losses:</strong> Heat that warms up the microwave itself, heat escaping into the kitchen, unpopped kernels (wasted fuel!).
                <br>Higher efficiency means more popped corn for the energy used!
            </div>
            <p><strong>The Nitty-Gritty Formula:</strong></p>
            <div class="formula-block">
                $\eta = \frac{\dot{m}_s \times (h_s - h_{fw})}{\dot{m}_f \times CV_f} \times 100\%$
            </div>
            <p>Let's break that down:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$\eta$ (eta): Our boiler's efficiency score.</li>
                <li>$\dot{m}_s$: How much steam the boiler is making (mass flow rate, e.g., kg/s).</li>
                <li>$h_s$: The energy (enthalpy) in each kg of steam leaving the boiler.</li>
                <li>$h_{fw}$: The energy in each kg of feedwater entering the boiler.
                    <br><em>So, $(h_s - h_{fw})$ is the net energy picked up by each kg of water.</em>
                </li>
                <li>$\dot{m}_f$: How much fuel is being burned (mass flow rate, e.g., kg/s).</li>
                <li>$CV_f$: The Calorific Value (heating value) of the fuel – how much energy is packed into each kg of fuel.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/boiler_efficiency.jpg" alt="Boiler Efficiency Concept" class="diagram">
            <div class="question-box">
                <p><strong>Self-Question:</strong> If a boiler has 85% efficiency, what does that mean?</p>
                <p><em>Answer: It means that for every 100 units of energy supplied by the fuel, 85 units are successfully transferred to the water to make steam, and 15 units are lost to various things like hot flue gases going up the chimney, heat radiating from the boiler surfaces, etc.</em></p>

            <h2>Equivalent Evaporation: A Standard Way to Compare Boilers</h2>
            <p>Imagine trying to compare two cars, but one reports fuel economy in "miles per gallon" and the other in "kilometers per liter." It's tricky! "Equivalent Evaporation" is a way to put all boilers on a level playing field for comparison, regardless of their actual operating pressures or temperatures.</p>
            <p>It answers the question: "If my boiler used all its useful heat output *just* to turn water already at 100°C into steam at 100°C, how much steam would it make?" This standard condition is called "from and at 100°C."</p>
            <p><strong>The Formula:</strong></p>
            <div class="formula-block">
                Equivalent Evaporation ($\dot{m}_e$) = $\frac{\dot{m}_s \times (h_s - h_{fw})}{h_{fg @ 100°C}}$
            </div>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$\dot{m}_e$: The equivalent evaporation rate (often kg of steam "from & at 100°C" per kg of fuel, or per hour).</li>
                <li>$h_{fg @ 100°C}$: The latent heat needed to vaporize 1 kg of water at 100°C into steam at 100°C. This is a standard value, famously around **2257 kJ/kg**.</li>
                <li>The term $\dot{m}_s \times (h_s - h_{fw})$ is the actual useful heat output of the boiler.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Think:</strong> It's like converting all currencies to US dollars before comparing prices. Equivalent evaporation converts a boiler's output to a "standard steam unit."

            <h2>Boiler Heat Balance Sheet: The Energy Detective's Report!</h2>
            <p>Where does all that fuel energy go? A heat balance sheet is like an energy audit for your boiler. It carefully tracks every bit of energy coming in (from fuel) and every bit going out – both the useful heat that makes steam and all the pesky heat losses.</p>
            <div class="question-box">
                <p><strong>Self-Question:</strong> Why bother with such a detailed report? Isn't knowing the efficiency enough?</p>
                <p><em>Answer: Good question! Efficiency gives you the overall grade. A heat balance sheet tells you *why* you got that grade by showing exactly where energy is being wasted. If your efficiency is low, the heat balance sheet helps pinpoint the biggest culprits (e.g., too much heat escaping up the chimney) so you can fix them!</em></p>
            </div>
            <p>It's based on the First Law of Thermodynamics: <strong>Energy In = Energy Out.</strong>
            <br>Typically done on the basis of 1 kg of fuel burned.</p>

            <p><strong>Heat Supplied (The "Budget"):</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat from combustion of fuel = Calorific Value (CV) of the fuel (kJ/kg of fuel). This is 100% of your energy budget.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Heat Utilized & Lost (Where the "Budget" is Spent):</strong> (per kg of fuel)</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Useful Heat Absorbed by Steam (The Main Goal!):</strong>
                    <div class="formula-block">$Q_{useful} = m_s \times (h_s - h_{fw})$</div>
                    (Here, $m_s$ is kg of steam produced per kg of fuel)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Heat Loss due to Dry Flue Gases (The Chimney Thief!):</strong> Hot gases escaping up the chimney carry away a lot of heat. This is often the biggest loss.
                    <div class="formula-block">$Q_{drygas} = m_g \times C_{pg} \times (T_g - T_a)$</div>
                    ($m_g$=mass of dry flue gas/kg fuel, $C_{pg}$=specific heat of dry gas, $T_g$=flue gas temp, $T_a$=ambient air temp)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Heat Loss due to Moisture in Fuel:</strong> If the fuel is damp, energy is used to evaporate that water.
                    <div class="formula-block">$Q_{moist\_fuel} = (\text{mass of moisture in fuel}) \times (\text{enthalpy gain of this moisture})$</div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Heat Loss due to Water from Burning Hydrogen in Fuel:</strong> When hydrogen (H) in fuel burns, it forms water (H<sub>2</sub>O). Energy is used to turn this water into vapor and heat it up.
                    <div class="formula-block">$Q_{H2O\_comb} = (\text{mass of } H_2O \text{ from } H_2) \times (\text{enthalpy gain of this water vapor})$</div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Heat Loss due to Moisture in Combustion Air:</strong> Air isn't perfectly dry; energy is used to heat this humidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat Loss due to Incomplete Combustion:</strong> If some fuel burns to CO instead of CO<sub>2</sub>, not all its energy is released.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat Loss due to Unburnt Carbon in Ash/Refuse:</strong> Bits of unburnt fuel in the ash are wasted energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat Loss due to Radiation and Convection (The "Leaky Bucket"):</strong> Heat escaping from the hot boiler surfaces to the surroundings. This is often the "unaccounted for" loss, found by difference:
                    <div class="formula-block">$Q_{rad\_conv} = \text{Heat Input} - \Sigma (\text{All other Utilized & Lost Heat})$</div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>A good heat balance sheet will list each item as kJ/kg of fuel AND as a percentage of the total heat input. It's a powerful tool for boiler doctors (engineers!) to diagnose problems and improve performance.</p>

                        <p>Boiler efficiency, as we've seen, is like its overall "grade":
                        <br>$\eta = (\text{Heat Output in Steam}) / (\text{Heat Input from Fuel}) \times 100\%$</p>
                        <p>A **Heat Balance Sheet** is the detailed "report card" showing how all the energy from the fuel is used or lost. Think of it like tracking your monthly budget: income (heat from fuel) on one side, and expenses (heat to steam + all losses) on the other. They must balance!</p>
                        <p><strong>Why do a Heat Balance?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Find the True Efficiency (Indirect Method):</strong> Sometimes it's easier to measure all the losses and say Efficiency = 100% - Sum of (% Losses).</li>
                            <li><strong>Become an Energy Detective:</strong> Identify exactly where heat is being wasted (e.g., too hot flue gases, unburnt fuel).</li>
                            <li><strong>Spot Improvement Areas:</strong> Knowing where losses occur helps engineers make changes to save fuel and money.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compare Performance:</strong> See how the boiler does with different fuels or at different operating loads.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The Process (Simplified):</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Energy In:</strong> Calculate total heat from burning fuel (mass of fuel × its CV).</li>
                            <li><strong>Useful Energy Out:</strong> Calculate heat absorbed by water to make steam (mass of steam × enthalpy increase).</li>
                            <li><strong>Energy Lost (The "Expenses"):</strong> Calculate all the major heat losses listed in the section above (dry flue gas, moisture, incomplete combustion, radiation, etc.).</li>
                            <li><strong>Balance the Books:</strong> Present everything in a table, usually per kg of fuel. The total "Energy In" must equal "Useful Energy Out + All Energy Losses."</li>
